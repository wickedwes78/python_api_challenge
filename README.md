## Description
_Module 6 Challenge - University of Adelaide - Data Analytics BootCamp_

Welcome to my analysis of whether the weather gets hotter as we approach the equater. 

The analysis was performed using pandas and matplotlib.

The WeatherPY analyses the weather conditions based on latitude  of a random sample of world cities. 

While the VacationPY determines 10 possible future vacations based on my preferred weather conditions as follows:
- A maximum temperature lower than 27 degrees but higher than 18;
- Humidity below 45%
- Wind speed below 10 m/s
- Cloudiness below 50%
